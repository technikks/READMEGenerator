GW Coding Homework #9

## Description 
This application is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The user will be prompted to input the following: 
* Project title
* Project description
* GitHub username
* Email address
* Installation requirement and instructions
* Usage examples
* Collaborators
* Tests
* License

Using the user input, the README file will generate the following sections: 
* Project Title
* Project Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation requirement and instructions
* Usage examples
* Credits
* Tests
* License
* Questions 

The Table of Contents will include links to the appropriate section of the README file. The Questions section will include links to the user GitHub page and email addresses. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command: 
```bash
node index.js
```
